This repository employs [Log4Brains](https://github.com/thomvaill/log4brains/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) to publish all Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) within it. These ADRs are to keep track of all decisions made across projects within my GitHub profile. If a project grows significantly then all relevant ADRs will be moved to its repository.

## Why? ü§î

1. To maintain a log of all decisions for historical and recall purposes. It's easy to forget WHY a certain approach was taken.
2. For visibility... Decisions in software development are trade-offs that depend on the situation and context. This will help in understanding certain decisions.
3. To practice crafting ADRs. This thought-provoking process will ideally lead to better decision-making.
4. To instill a level of professionalism in side projects.

## Structure üß±

There are two distinct levels of ADRs:
- Global: Decisions that impact all repositories.
- Repository specific: Decisions exclusive to a particular project or product within a repository.

The repository-specific ones are added as 'packages' within the Log4Brains structure. You can identify these by the package name next to the title within the user interface.

## Whats the damage (WTD)? üí∞
