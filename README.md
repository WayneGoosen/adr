# ADR - An Experiment with Architecture Decision Records

This repository employs Log4Brains to publish all Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) within it.

The experiment: Use ADRs to keep track of all decisions made across projects within my GitHub profile. If a project grows significantly, move all relevant ADRs to its repository.

## Why?

1. To maintain a log of all decisions for historical and recall purposes. It's easy to forget WHY a certain approach was taken.
2. For visibility... Decisions in software development are trade-offs that depend on the situation and context. This will help in understanding certain decisions.
3. To practice crafting ADRs. This thought-provoking process will ideally lead to better decision-making.
4. To instill a level of professionalism in side projects.

## Structure

There are two distinct levels of ADRs:
- Global: Decisions that impact all repositories.
- Repository specific: Decisions exclusive to a particular project or product within a repository.

The repository-specific ones are added as 'packages' within the Log4Brains structure. You can identify these by the package name next to the title within the user interface.


# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs are automatically published to our Log4brains architecture knowledge base:

Please use this link to browse them.

## Development

If not already done, install Log4brains:

```bash
npm install -g log4brains
```

To preview the knowledge base locally, run:

```bash
log4brains preview
```

In preview mode, the Hot Reload feature is enabled: any change you make to a markdown file is applied live in the UI.

To create a new ADR interactively, run:

```bash
log4brains adr new
```
