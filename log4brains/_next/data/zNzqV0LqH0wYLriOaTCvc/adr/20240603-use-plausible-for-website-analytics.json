The main options we are considering are Google Analytics and Plausible. We need to evaluate these options and make a decision.\n\n## Decision Drivers\n\n- Ease of implementation (time to implement)\n- Data privacy and compliance\n- Feature set\n- Performance\n\n## Considered Options\n\n- Google Analytics\n- Plausible\n\nA PoC was done with the Astro blog website, unfortunately Google Analytics was not working within the time limit and Plausible worked straight out of the box.\n\n## Decision Outcome\n\nChosen option: \"Plausible\", because it provides a lightweight and privacy-focused analytics solution that was the fastest to implement.\n\n### Positive Consequences\n\n- Improved data privacy and compliance\n- Lightweight and fast-loading analytics script\n\n### Negative Consequences\n\n- Limited feature set compared to Google Analytics\n- Less integration options with other tools\n- Paid plans only.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Plausible website](https://plausible.io/)\n- [Google Analytics website](https://analytics.google.com/)"},"creationDate":"2024-06-03T19:23:21.000Z","lastEditDate":"2024-06-03T19:23:21.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"WayneGoosen","publicationDate":"2024-06-03T21:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"docs/adr/20240603-use-plausible-for-website-analytics.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/adr/adr/docs/adr/20240603-use-plausible-for-website-analytics.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/WayneGoosen/adr/blob/master/docs/adr/20240603-use-plausible-for-website-analytics.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
